Hi sis and bro, I'm Jiazhen from China. I have just finished my studies in Statistics at Uppsala university this June in 2024.

Let's call myself a Statistician for now, an Open to work hobo. 

Here is my little world, I have archived some of my previous projects and some traces of my previous teaching assistant works.

By the way, I've attached my Linkedin link www.linkedin.com/in/jiazhen-jing-9b4616267, so please come hang out with me, I'm super fun!
